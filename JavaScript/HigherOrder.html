<!--The function which accepts another function as an argument, such functions are called Higher Order functions-->
<!--The Function which is being passed an argument to another functions,
such functions are called as Callback Functions.

what is the use of arrow function:
In java script we have a many higher order functions like filter(), map(),
reduce(()=>{}), forEach(()=>{}) these higher order functions accepts
another function as an arguments so when we are passing another
function as an argument its better if we use arrow function 
Because arrow functions provides most consized way for the callback functions
why consized way means shortsyntax..
nono lengthy functions we can replace regular functions-->
